The PIRCHE Automated HLA Upload Tool is an Excel-based utility that streamlines the transfer of HLA typing data from the laboratory information system (e.g., HistoTrac) to the PIRCHE platform for immunological risk assessment and epitope-based matching.

Purpose and Rationale:
Manually transferring HLA results into PIRCHE can be time-consuming and error-prone. The automated tool addresses these challenges by:
Parsing and transforming LIS-exported HLA typings into a format compliant with PIRCHE requirements.
Reducing manual data manipulation, thereby improving both efficiency and data integrity.
Enabling rapid submission of cases for PIRCHE scoring to support clinical decision workflows.

Key Features:
Excel-based implementation. Avoids the need for specialized software installations; works within existing laboratory computing environments.
Converts HistoTrac or other LIS exports into PIRCHE-readable structured fields.

Batch processing:
The tool can prepare multiple typings simultaneously for bulk upload to PIRCHE.

Workflow:
Import patient and donor(s) HLA typings from HistoTrac (or similar LIS) using a predefined template into the Excel tool.
Then, copy and paste the HLA typings into the PIRCHE platform using embedded formulas and logic.

The PIRCHE Automated HLA Upload Tool is an Excel-based utility that streamlines the transfer of HLA typing data from the laboratory information system (e.g., HistoTrac) to the PIRCHE platform for immunological risk assessment and epitope-based matching.

Purpose and Rationale:
Manually transferring HLA results into PIRCHE can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent across personnel. The automated tool addresses these challenges by:
Parsing and transforming LIS-exported HLA typings into a format compliant with PIRCHE requirements.
Reducing manual data manipulation, thereby improving both efficiency and data integrity.
Enabling rapid submission of cases for PIRCHE scoring to support clinical decision workflows.

Key Features:
Excel-based implementation. Avoids the need for specialized software installations; works within existing laboratory computing environments.
Converts HistoTrac or other LIS exports into PIRCHE-readable structured fields.

Batch processing:
The tool can prepare multiple typings simultaneously for bulk upload to PIRCHE.

Typical Workflow:
Export patient and donor(s) HLA typings from HistoTrac (or similar LIS) using a predefined query or template.
Import the exported data into the Excel tool.
The tool auto-populates PIRCHE-formatted fields using embedded formulas and logic.
